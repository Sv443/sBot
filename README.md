## Invitation:
Please visit [this page](https://sv443.net/r/sBot) to either add the bot to your server or to join the support server.

<br><br><br><br><br><br>

## Usage:
To view all available commands, type `^help` into any channel<br>
If you wanna see the admin commands, use `^adminhelp` instead.<br><br><br>

If you cloned the repo and want to start the bot you need NodeJS installed and you have to create a file called `.env` that contains two lines: `BOT_TOKEN=your_bot_token` and `STEAM_KEY=your_steam_api_key`. Afterwards you need to open CMD and `cd` to the project folder. Then, type `node .` to start the bot.
